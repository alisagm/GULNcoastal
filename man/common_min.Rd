\title{Common Minimum Distance Calculations for Beach Transects}
\description{
Functions for calculating common minimum distance points across transects.
This hybrid implementation combines row-appending approach with accuracy-aware
calculations for uncertainty, confidence, and slope.
}
\details{
For land-to-water (non-cross-island) transects, the common minimum distance
ensures all transects share a consistent landward integration boundary across
years, enabling valid temporal comparisons.
}
\section{Distance Tolerance}{

Distance tolerance is point-specific (3 * sigma_h per point):
\itemize{
  \item Worst case: 3 * 0.027m = 0.081m (low accuracy years)
  \item Best case: 3 * 0.009m = 0.027m (high accuracy years)
}

Points within 3σ_h are statistically indistinguishable from the target
distance (99.7\% confidence interval). This error-aware approach adapts
to varying measurement accuracy across years.
