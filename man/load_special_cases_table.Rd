\title{Load Special Cases Table from CSV}
\usage{
load_special_cases_table(path)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to CSV file containing special cases table}
}
\value{
A validated tibble with columns: park, year, transect, sigma_h, sigma_v, accuracy_tier
}
\description{
Reads a CSV file containing transect-specific accuracy overrides.
These values take precedence over the general accuracy_table.
}
\details{
Expected CSV format (with header row):
```
park,year,transect,sigma_h,sigma_v,accuracy_tier
GUIS,2018,fp07,0.015,0.120,C_Moderate
GUIS,2018,fp08,0.015,0.120,C_Moderate
...
```

Use this for transects that have different accuracy values than the
park/year default (e.g., different survey methods within the same year).
