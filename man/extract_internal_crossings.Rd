\title{Extract Internal Zero Crossings}
\usage{
extract_internal_crossings(zero_points, left_boundary, right_boundary)
}
\arguments{
\item{zero_points}{Data frame from \code{\link{identify_all_zero_elevation_points}}.
Must include \code{sigma_h} column}

\item{left_boundary}{Left integration boundary (numeric)}

\item{right_boundary}{Right integration boundary (numeric)}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of distances where internal zero crossings occur
}
\description{
Helper function to extract zero crossings that occur between the integration
boundaries (excluding the boundary intercepts themselves).
}
\details{
Uses error-aware tolerance: a point is considered "internal" if it's at least
3*sigma_h away from both boundaries.
}
