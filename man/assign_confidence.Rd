\title{Assign Confidence Level Based on Slope and Method}
\usage{
assign_confidence(slope, method, extrap_distance = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{slope}{Slope magnitude (m/m) - can be vector}

\item{method}{"measured", "interpolated", or "extrapolated" - single value or vector}

\item{extrap_distance}{Extrapolation distance (meters), NA if not extrapolated - can be vector}
}
\value{
Character vector: "high", "moderate", or "low"
}
\description{
Vectorized function that assigns confidence ratings based on the detection
method and geometric characteristics of the zero-crossing.
}
\details{
Confidence levels:
\describe{
  \item{high}{Measured points, or interpolated with slope > 0.05}
  \item{moderate}{Interpolated with slope 0.02-0.05, or short extrapolations <= 5m}
  \item{low}{Interpolated with slope < 0.02, or extrapolations > 5m}
}
}
