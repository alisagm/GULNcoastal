\title{Calculate Transect Geometry Metrics}
\usage{
calculate_transect_metrics(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame with columns: \code{transect}, \code{year}, \code{distance}}
}
\value{
Data frame with columns:
  \describe{
    \item{transect}{Transect identifier}
    \item{year}{Year of measurement}
    \item{transect_length}{Total transect length for this year (meters)}
    \item{overlap_m}{Shared distance interval across all years (meters)}
    \item{overlap_pct}{Overlap as percentage of transect length}
  }
}
\description{
Calculates transect length and overlap metrics for each transect-year.
These metrics are independent of the AUC calculation method and provide
information about data coverage and consistency across years.
}
\section{Overlap Calculation}{

Overlap is calculated as the shared distance interval across all years for
a given transect. A transect with only one year has zero overlap by definition.
The overlap percentage is relative to each year's transect length.
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Calculate geometry metrics for all transects
metrics <- calculate_transect_metrics(cleaned_data)

# Identify transects with low overlap
low_overlap <- metrics |>
  filter(overlap_pct < 50)
}
}
