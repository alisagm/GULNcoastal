\title{Add Uncertainty and Classification to Measured Points}
\usage{
add_measured_uncertainty(data_accuracy)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_accuracy}{Data frame with sigma_h and sigma_v columns, plus
transect grouping variables (transect, year, park, cross_island)}
}
\value{
Data frame with uncertainty, confidence, and point_type columns
}
\description{
Wrapper function that applies slope-dependent uncertainty calculation and
classifies measured zero-crossings in a single step.
}
\details{
This function:
  1. Calculates slope-dependent uncertainty for measured points
  2. Identifies "measured zero" points (within 1.96*sigma_v of datum)
  3. Assigns confidence levels (all measured data = "high")
  4. Initializes columns for derived points (extrap_distance, etc.)
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Apply after assign_accuracy()
data_with_accuracy <- assign_accuracy(transect_data, accuracy_table, special_cases)
data_classified <- add_measured_uncertainty(data_with_accuracy)
}
