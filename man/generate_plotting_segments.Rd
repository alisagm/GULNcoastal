\title{Generate Segments for Plotting from Weighted Segmentation}
\usage{
generate_plotting_segments(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Dataframe for one transect-year with columns:
- distance, elevation (original), sigma_v, point_type}
}
\value{
List of lists, where each element represents a segment with:
  - is_positive: Logical, TRUE if segment is above sea level
  - x: Numeric vector of distances for this segment
  - y: Numeric vector of ORIGINAL elevations for this segment
}
\description{
Creates segment data structure expected by plotting functions. Segments are
identified based on probability-weighted elevations, but the actual elevation
values used for plotting are the ORIGINAL (unweighted) elevations.
}
\details{
Process:
  1. Calculate weighted elevations to identify segments
  2. Mark positive vs negative regions based on weighted elevations
  3. Group consecutive points with same sign into segments
  4. For each segment, return ORIGINAL elevations (not weighted)
     so plotting shows actual measured/interpolated values

This ensures plots display the original data while using probability-weighted
segmentation logic to determine what gets shaded as "above sea level".
