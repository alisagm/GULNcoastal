\title{Format year sequence for plot titles}
\usage{
format_year_sequence(years, park)
}
\arguments{
\item{years}{Numeric vector of years to format. Will be sorted automatically.}

\item{park}{Character. Park identifier used for documentation purposes.
The park parameter is currently not used in the logic but maintained for
API consistency and potential future park-specific formatting rules.}
}
\value{
A character string with the formatted year sequence.
  Examples:
  \describe{
    \item{Single year:}{"2010"}
    \item{Two years:}{"2010, 2012"}
    \item{Consecutive run:}{"2010-2016" (for 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016)}
    \item{Mixed:}{"2010-2014, 2018, 2020" (for 2010, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2020)}
  }
}
\description{
Intelligently formats a sequence of years into a compact, readable string.
Consecutive runs of more than 2 years (based on expected survey cadence)
are formatted as ranges (e.g., "2010-2016"), while non-consecutive years
remain comma-separated (e.g., "2010, 2014").
}
\details{
The function uses \code{YEAR_CADENCE} (default: 2 years) to determine
whether years are consecutive. This respects typical survey intervals where
sampling occurs every 2 years rather than annually. Runs of more than 2
consecutive years are collapsed into ranges, while shorter runs or isolated
years remain comma-separated.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Consecutive years (2-year cadence)
format_year_sequence(c(2010, 2012, 2014, 2016), park = "PAIS")
# Returns: "2010-2016"

# Non-consecutive years
format_year_sequence(c(2010, 2014, 2018), park = "GUIS")
# Returns: "2010, 2014, 2018"

# Mixed consecutive and non-consecutive
format_year_sequence(c(2010, 2012, 2014, 2020, 2022), park = "PAIS")
# Returns: "2010-2014, 2020, 2022"
}
