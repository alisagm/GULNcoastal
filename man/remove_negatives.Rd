\title{Remove Extraneous Negative Elevations}
\usage{
remove_negatives(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame. Must contain an \code{elevation} column with numeric values.}
}
\value{
Data frame with leading and trailing negative elevations removed,
  except for one value at each end (if present).
}
\description{
Removes negative elevation values from the beginning and end of a transect
profile, while preserving one leading and one trailing negative value for
proper boundary detection. This is useful for cleaning beach profile data
where negative elevations (below sea level) at the ends are artifacts.
}
\details{
The function operates in two steps:
  \enumerate{
    \item Leading negatives: If the first elevation is negative, keeps only
      the value immediately before the first positive elevation.
    \item Trailing negatives: If the last elevation is negative, keeps only
      the value immediately after the last positive elevation.
  }

  This preserves boundary information while removing spurious underwater
  measurements that extend beyond the area of interest.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create sample data with leading/trailing negatives
sample_df <- data.frame(
  distance = 1:10,
  elevation = c(-2, -1, 0.5, 1, 2, 1.5, 0.5, -0.5, -1, -2)
)

# Remove extraneous negatives
cleaned <- remove_negatives(sample_df)
# Result keeps one negative at start and end: -1, 0.5, ..., 0.5, -0.5
}

}
