resolve_filter(filter, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{filter}{data_filter object}

\item{data}{Dataframe with transect data (must have park, year, transect columns)}
}
\value{
List with resolved values:
  - parks: Character vector of resolved park codes
  - years: Numeric vector of resolved years (union across parks)
  - transects: Character vector of resolved transect IDs
  - park_year_details: List with per-park year selection details
}
\description{
Applies the semantic filter to actual data, resolving year selections
per-park and computing final year/park/transect lists.
}
\details{
Resolution order:
1. Parks: Determine which parks are in scope
2. Years: Apply year_selector to each park's years, union results
3. Transects: Filter and apply exclusions
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
filter <- create_data_filter(year_selector = years_baseline_recent(2))
resolved <- resolve_filter(filter, data)
print(resolved)
}
